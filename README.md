# Euler-Path

https://brendon-k.github.io/Euler-Path

Generates a graph and if it can find an Euler Path on the graph, then it will display the start and end nodes along with numbered lines that show the path to take.

Might run slow with big numbers. Only accepts up to 26 nodes because 1. it's not very optimized and 2. I didn't want to deal with node names past z.
